### Bio Section

My Story
```

**Body Text**
```
I've spent my career at the intersection of technology, operations, and community development. As Executive Director of the HigherSelf Network since 2012, I've had the privilege of building systems that empower communities and drive meaningful change.

My journey began in community organizing, where I saw firsthand the gap between visionary ideas and operational reality. Too many great organizations struggle not because they lack vision or passion, but because they lack the operational infrastructure to sustain their work. I made it my mission to bridge that gap.

Over the years, I've developed expertise in full-stack development, automation technologies, and operations architecture. But more importantly, I've learned how to apply these technical skills in service of community-driven missions. I believe that technology should empower people, not replace them, and that the best systems are those that center human relationships and community values.

Today, I work with mission-driven organizations to build the operational foundations they need to thrive. Whether I'm designing systems for The 7 Space art gallery, building automation for A.M. Consulting, or developing the HigherSelf Network Server, my goal is always the same: to create sustainable infrastructure that enables organizations to focus on their mission.
